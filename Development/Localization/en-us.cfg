	#LOC_TerrasIgnotas_BoyuDescription = Boyu. A very swirly planet with a masterfully crafted placeholder description.
	
	#LOC_TerrasIgnotas_HadronDescription = Hadron is the closest neutron star to Kerbin, at about 7 light-years away. Due to Hadron's age, it's hypothesized that it may have caused the Kordovician Mass Extinction, which stripped off Kerbin's Ozone Layer, and henceforth killed 95% of all life on the planet. Any planets and potentially life that may have existed close around the old Hadron are now all gone, leaving behind the outer planets to roam and rummage around Hadron as it slowly dies.
	
	#LOC_TerrasIgnotas_GobekDescription = Gobek, which in the language of the Ancients means "Center", seems to be at the center off all the orbits of nearby stars. It's name's meaning could be a coincedence, or the Ancients could have known about this Supermassive Black Hole. MUST BE ALIENS THEN!!11ONE!
	
	#LOC_TerrasIgnotas_EpochonDescription = According to myth, Epochón "contains upon and within it Wisdom like bu Galaksi has not seen before or since". What secrets could the planet hold?
	
	#LOC_TerrasIgnotas_JilDescription = Jil is a strange gas planet, as its atmosphere is an exact copy of that of a gas planet from the bad science-fiction movie <i>1138 Planets</i>. The color, however, is unique.
	
	#LOC_TerrasIgnotas_PLACEHOLDER = PLACEHOLDER
	
	#LOC_TERRASIGNOTAS_PlaceholderDescription = This is a very interesting planet. I wish I could tell you more, but this is a placeholder description, so I can't.
	
	//Easter Eggs
	#LOC_TerrasIgnotas_PaleBlueDotA = Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

 It would be nice to have that next to a picture of kerbin or something. Just an idea.

	#LOC_TerrasIgnotas_HadronDescription = Hadron ist der von Kerbin aus gesehen nächste Neutronenstern, in einer Entfernung von ungefär 121 Lichtjahren. Aufgrund von Hadrons Alter wird vermutet, dass er für das kordovizische Massenaussterben verantwortlich sein könnte, bei dem Kerbins Ozonschicht zerstört, und 95% des Lebens auf dem Planeten ausgelöscht wurden. Alle inneren Planeten sowie potentielles Leben um Hadron sind nun verschwunden, die äußeren Planeten wandern weiterhin durch den Weltraum während Hadron langsam stirbt.
